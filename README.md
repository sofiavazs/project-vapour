# Project VAPOUR Express 👾 💨
This project is the frontend part to display the data I've built in my first [API](https://express-vapour.herokuapp.com/) using Node.js in Express. 
I've built the frontend as a multi-page using React and React Router

## Planning & What I learned 🧩
I wanted to have the full experience of building both the backend and the frontend, so it was really fun to be able to build and visualise what I built on the backend. 

The home page has two main sections, which are two different components that show two different endpoints. 
* Favorites section - shows my favourite games 
* Library - show all my games library 

There's also a counter in the middle that shows the total games I own and this is built on the backend. 

Once the user clicks on a game, then he's redirected to that specific game's page, which shows speficic information regarding that game, this is fetched from another endpoint built in the backend. 

I was also to implement a loading page and a custom 404 Page Not Found page, in case the url doesn't match any of my games in the library.
